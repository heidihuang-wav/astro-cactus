## Top 3 
##### Being Mortal | Atul Gawande | 5★
Has helped me initiate important conversations about death and dying with my parents and grandmother. Being in my early 20s, I often feel invincible, but this book has made me think about my values, what matters to me, and how *I* would like to die when the time comes.

Interested in learning more about geriatrics and end-of-life care after reading this book, I watched this documentary called *[End Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_Game_(2018_film))* on Netflix, which I also recommend.

##### The Gene | Siddhartha Mukherjee | 5★
Engaging, digestible, and fun overview of genetics. Loved learning about the historical contexts of experiments and people I had come across in textbooks and classes. 


##### Bad Blood | John Carreyrou | 5★
Is nonfiction but reads like a gripping novel. Couldn't put the book down. 
The book covers these things and more:
* The dangers of unchecked ambition
* The importance of proper oversight and due diligence
* Why *who* you know can make all the difference
* Silicon Valley's "fake it till you make it" culture
* The value of investigative journalism: Carreyrou's reporting helped expose the truth about Theranos
* Ethical responsibilities in healthcare
* The role of fear and intimidation in corporate culture
* The consequences of prioritizing image over substance
