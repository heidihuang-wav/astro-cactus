### Follow your curiosity. Don't be afraid to cut bullshit out of your life.
At the beginning of Fall semester of junior year, I was enrolled in an upper-division public health course, but I quickly realized it wasn’t the right fit for me. I *did* enjoy some classes, such as Public Health 150D: Introduction to Health Policy and Management and Public Health 142: Intro to Biostatistics, but the rest of the major requirements did not interest me. While public health is important, I felt the opportunity cost of staying in the rest of those classes for the sake of completing the major just so I could have "Public Health BA" on my diploma was too high. 
		
A conversation with a friend who majored in public health and later pivoted to Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) further encouraged me to drop the major. During office hours, a public health professor had explained to him that many universities don’t offer undergraduate public health programs because public health is a lens through which to apply foundational knowledge gained in fields like chemistry, infectious disease, or political science—knowledge that is typically built during undergrad—with public health pursued at the graduate level.
		
I decided to drop the public health major and commit my time to MCB in the fall of my third year. ==Instead of pursuing breadth, I wanted to focus on depth==. Around the same time, I had also just joined the Wilson Lab. After reading Walter Isaacson’s _The Code Breaker_ the summer before, I became fascinated by CRISPR. I reached out to Prof. Wilson (aka Ross), whose lab focuses on CRISPR delivery, to ask about joining as an undergrad researcher. To my excitement, Ross responded, and I was eager to learn all about biochemistry and genome editing.
		
Before this, I was part of the Knight Lab at UCSF, but the long commute made it challenging to go to lab more often, attend meetings regularly, and fully integrate into the lab. In contrast, the Wilson Lab is located at the Innovative Genomics Institute, just a 15-minute walk from where I live and only five to ten minutes from my classes, making it much more accessible.
