Building muscle is not easy, but it *is* straightforward. At least it *should* be. 

These days, there is a sea of information online all saying different things, so it can be confusing to know where to start. 

Going to the gym should not be that complicated, especially when you're just starting out, you don't need to be listening to let science-based lifters talking about which is more optimal for muscle growth - seated vs. lying down hamstring curls - paralyze you.

All of that is just noise.  It's really just 3 parts to building muscle: eat, train, and sleep (rest).

## Eat
### Eat enough protein
How much is enough? 
**0.8 grams of protein per pound of (lean) body weight.** Feel free to just use your body weight, forget about the lean part, because it's ok to overshoot a bit. 

To build muscle
if you're just starting out - you can likely build muscle and lose fat at the same time, especially if you're starting at a higher body fat percentage. It's fine if you eat at maintenance. You don't need to do cutting and bulking cycles (that's for intermediate and advanced lifters).

### (optional) Understand your caloric needs
As long as you're eating enough protein, eating intuitively otherwise should be good enough. 

Counting calories is not necessary but can be helpful to understand how much you're eating so that you develop an intuition for how many calories you're consuming without having to track too strictly.

To understand how many calories you should be eatig, Use a TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) calculator as a starting point. I recommend [this one](https://www.sailrabbit.com/bmr/).

If unsure about your activity level, try to underestimate how active you are.

The number of maintenance calories the TDEE calculator gives you is just an estimate - you have to test it out yourself. Try your best to track calories and eat at maintenance according to the number the TDEE calculator gives you, and weigh yourself to make sure you're really maintaining weight. If you're gaining or losing, then adjust your calorie intake accordingly.

## Train

In your first few years of lifting, **following a structured program + progressive overload = gains.**

How to read these tables:
* DB = dumbbell
* lat pulldowns / pull ups = lat pulldowns OR pull ups, whichever you prefer. They achieve the same effect as far as we're concerned. It's up to you to do the exercise that feels better to you, or if you want to introduce some variety into your workouts by switching it up, feel free to do so.

### Beginner's 3-day PPL program

### Beginner's 4-day ULUL program

If going to the gym 4 days a week fits your schedule better, follow this program.

## Sleep (rest and recover)
### Sleep 7-9 hours every day

### Take rest days
Ideally, they are "active" rest days - still be walking around and staying lightly active. But, it's ok if things get in the way. 

## Mindset and Motivation
With enough consistency, the gains shall cometh.
